## What You'll Need

Before installing the CEMS client, you need two things from your CEMS admin:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Server URL" icon="link">
    Example: `https://cems.example.com`
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Key" icon="key">
    Starts with `cems_usr_...`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Don't have a server yet? See [Server Deployment](/deployment/overview) to set up your own CEMS server.
</Note>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the installer">
    The easiest way to install CEMS is with the one-line installer:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://getcems.com/install.sh | bash
    ```

    The installer will:
    1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if missing
    2. Install CEMS CLI tools (`cems`, `cems-server`, `cems-observer`)
    3. Prompt for your API URL and key
    4. Let you choose which IDEs to configure

    <Accordion title="What if I want non-interactive install?">
      Set environment variables and pipe directly:

      ```bash
      CEMS_API_KEY=your-key-here CEMS_API_URL=https://cems.example.com \
        curl -fsSL https://getcems.com/install.sh | bash
      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your IDE">
    The installer will ask which IDE(s) to configure:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Claude Code">
        Installs to `~/.claude/`:
        - 6 hooks (session lifecycle)
        - 6 skills (`/remember`, `/recall`, `/share`, `/forget`, `/context`, memory guide)
        - 2 commands
        - Settings merged into `settings.json`
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Cursor">
        Installs to `~/.cursor/`:
        - 3 hooks
        - 5 skills
        - MCP config merged into `mcp.json`
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Codex">
        Installs to `~/.codex/`:
        - 3 commands
        - 2 skills
        - MCP config merged into `config.toml`
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Goose">
        Installs to `~/.config/goose/`:
        - MCP extension block merged into `config.yaml`
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    You can select multiple IDEs or choose "all" to configure everything.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Check that CEMS is installed and can connect to your server:

    ```bash
    cems --version
    ```

    ```bash
    cems health
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    ✓ Connected to CEMS server
    ✓ API key valid
    ✓ User: yourname
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Memory

Now let's add your first memory and recall it.

<CodeGroup>
```bash CLI
# Add a personal preference
cems add "I prefer Python for backend development"

# Search for it
cems search "backend preferences"

# List all your memories
cems list
```

```bash Claude Code Skills
# In Claude Code, use slash commands:
/remember I prefer Python for backend development
/recall backend preferences
/context
```

```bash Cursor Skills
# In Cursor:
/cems-remember I prefer Python for backend development
/cems-recall backend preferences
/cems-context
```
</CodeGroup>

## Try Automatic Memory Injection

CEMS automatically injects relevant memories when you chat with your AI assistant.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add project-specific memories">
    In a git repository, add some project context:

    ```bash
    /remember This project uses PostgreSQL with snake_case column names
    /remember We follow REST conventions with /api/v1/ prefix
    /remember Tests use pytest with fixtures in tests/conftest.py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a new session">
    Close and reopen your IDE, or start a new Claude Code session.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask a related question">
    Try asking something related to your memories:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```plaintext Claude Code
    "How should I name this new database table?"
    ```

    ```plaintext Claude Code
    "Where should I add a new API endpoint?"
    ```

    ```plaintext Claude Code
    "How do I write tests for this function?"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Your AI assistant will have your project conventions in context automatically!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Memory Scope

CEMS supports two memory scopes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Personal Memory" icon="user">
    Use `/remember` for personal preferences and private notes.
    
    Only you can see these memories.

    ```bash
    /remember I prefer dark mode
    /remember My testing style uses fixtures
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Memory" icon="users">
    Use `/share` for team conventions and decisions.
    
    Everyone on your team can see these.

    ```bash
    /share API endpoints use /api/v1/ prefix
    /share We deploy to production via Coolify
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Categories and Tags">
    Organize memories with categories and tags:

    ```bash
    /remember --category preferences I prefer Python type hints
    /remember --category decisions --tags db,postgres We use PostgreSQL
    ```

    Search by category:
    ```bash
    /recall --category decisions database choice
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project-Scoped Memories">
    Memories automatically capture the git project context.

    When you create a memory in `myorg/webapp`, it gets tagged with `project:myorg/webapp`.

    When you search from that same project, those memories get boosted.
    When you search from a different project, they're deprioritized.

    This prevents cross-project noise while preserving access to all memories.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Observer Daemon">
    The observer daemon runs in the background and watches your session transcripts.

    It extracts high-level observations like:
    - "User prefers to deploy via Docker Compose"
    - "Project uses PostgreSQL for primary storage"
    - "Team follows conventional commits style"

    These observations are stored as memories and help build context over time.

    Check observer status:
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep cems-observer
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maintenance Jobs">
    CEMS runs scheduled maintenance to keep your memory clean:

    | Job | Schedule | Purpose |
    |-----|----------|----------|
    | Consolidation | Nightly 3 AM | Merge duplicates |
    | Observation Reflection | Nightly 3:30 AM | Condense observations |
    | Summarization | Weekly Sun 4 AM | Compress old memories |
    | Re-indexing | Monthly 1st 5 AM | Rebuild embeddings |

    Trigger maintenance manually:
    ```bash
    cems maintenance --job consolidation
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## CLI Reference

Here are the most common CLI commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Status & Health
cems status        # System status
cems health        # Server health check
cems --version     # Show version
```

```bash Memory Operations
cems add "content"              # Add memory
cems search "query"             # Search memories
cems list                       # List all memories
cems list --category decisions  # Filter by category
```

```bash Maintenance
cems update                  # Update to latest version
cems update --hooks          # Re-deploy hooks only
cems maintenance --job NAME  # Run maintenance job
```

```bash Configuration
cems setup                   # Re-run setup wizard
cems uninstall              # Remove hooks/skills
cems uninstall --all        # Remove everything including credentials
```
</CodeGroup>

## Updating CEMS

CEMS auto-updates when you start a new Claude Code session (if >24 hours old).

To update manually:

```bash
cems update          # Pull latest + re-deploy hooks/skills
cems update --hooks  # Re-deploy hooks only (skip package upgrade)
```

<Note>
  Auto-update can be disabled: `export CEMS_AUTO_UPDATE=0`
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Memory not being recalled">
    1. Check credentials: `cat ~/.cems/credentials`
    2. Test connection: `cems health`
    3. Test search: `cems search "test"`
    4. Check hook output:
       ```bash
       echo '{"prompt": "test"}' | uv run ~/.claude/hooks/cems_user_prompts_submit.py
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skills not appearing">
    1. Verify files exist:
       - Claude Code: `ls ~/.claude/skills/cems/`
       - Cursor: `ls ~/.cursor/skills/cems-recall/`
    2. Restart your IDE
    3. Type `/` and look for `remember`, `recall`, etc.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Re-install hooks">
    ```bash
    cems setup    # Re-runs the full setup
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
